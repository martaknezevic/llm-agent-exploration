Explore{} the relationship between the variables by alternating between Action{} steps. There are two types of Action:
(1) set(<variable1>=<value1>, ...), which assigns values to the variables,
(2) finish({}), which finishes the exploration{}.
Observation returns all the variables after value assignment using Action set().
{}{} 

Each step is written in a new line followed by ":" and step content, as following:
<step_name>: <step_content>
{}
{}
{}
You are a researcher exploring the relationship between the variables in order to find the correct equation that models variable D.
Explore the variables using defined steps and find correct equation.{} Do not write text outside of the defined steps.
